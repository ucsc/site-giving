Quan Tran got some much-needed financial support—and a big morale boost—when she received a $2,500 Senior Class Council scholarship, with money raised by members of the Class of 2013.

Tran&#8217;s parents immigrated from Vietnam. They own a beauty salon and never went to college, but they&#8217;ve worked long hours, six to seven days a week, to support their family.  
Tran, 20, who is taking science classes to prepare for medical school, often finds that finances are tight.

&#8220;The journey to med school is not an easy one,&#8221; Tran said. &#8220;Earning the scholarship felt like strong reassurance that I am doing the right thing, and will reach my goal.&#8221; In turn, Tran is &#8220;paying it forward&#8221; by planning to open a free medical clinic in an underserved area.

The Senior Class Council encourages students to honor their class by donating $20.14. This year, the council is well on its way toward raising enough money to potentially distribute $2,500 scholarships to two juniors next year.

The donations are passed on to the next year to do with it what they please. The money for Quan&#8217;s scholarship came from the Class of 2013, while the Class of 2014 decided to give the money away through scholarships and chose Quan.
