Monica (Stevenson &#8217;95, literature [creative writing] and psychology) is now senior director of marketing for [LeapFrog](http://www.leapfrog.com/en-us/home), an educational company in Emeryville that makes toys, kids&#8217; learning tablets, and games.

The Browns said Monica&#8217;s UCSC experience created a template for her life. Monica is also now a contributor to the university.

&#8220;UCSC certainly provided a basis for Monica&#8217;s later success, in her first job, then as valedictorian of her MBA class at UC Berkeley, and in her current work at Leapfrog,&#8221; Marian Brown said. &#8220;It makes sense to us to continue to support the school that gave our daughter such a good foundation.&#8221;

The parents also give to UCSC to show their commitment &#8220;to the multiple benefits for all the people of California of a strong public higher education system. The education and the research bring good jobs, prosperity, and more knowledgeable citizens.&#8221;

The UC system remains excellent, but it can&#8217;t do all it&#8217;s capable of because of the state&#8217;s lack of funds.

&#8220;So we also continue to support UC Santa Cruz to help strengthen a vital educational institution for the well-being of Californians and our state,&#8221; continued the Browns.

As ardent backers of the university, the Browns keep track of goings-on at UCSC by reading campus newsletters and attending university programs.

&#8220;We&#8217;re impressed with the new developments and research being done by faculty and students,&#8221; Ken Brown said. &#8220;We like the fact that Santa Cruz fosters a close collaboration between different disciplines. Educational and research work like that done at Santa Cruz will help California retain its unique character and promise for the future.&#8221;
