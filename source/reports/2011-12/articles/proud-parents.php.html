<div class="headline">
<h2>Proud parents honor their sons by giving back</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodycontent"><p>Proud parents Stephen and Linda Crowe were looking for a meaningful and enduring way to honor their son, Jeremy, a fourth-year undergraduate student in UCSC's computer science program.<br />
    <br />
    They wanted to acknowledge his studies and his strong performance, while also giving a boost to the program itself.<br />
    <br />
    Crowe, a new UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee and a retired vice president of finance and CFO of Chevron Corporation, found a way to achieve both goals: He and Linda are giving $100,000 in unrestricted funds to UCSC's Computer Engineering Department to help other students have the transformative experiences Jeremy had.<br />
    <br />
    The gift stemmed in part from Crowe's visits with UCSC Computer Science Department Chair Jim Whitehead. &quot;What a terrific guy,&quot; Crowe said. Together they hashed out some possible goals for the unrestricted funds, including a program that could bring guest lecturers &quot;over the hill&quot; from Silicon Valley to teach computer science courses, building bridges with the tech industry while adding an extra dose of real-world heft to the classroom experience.<br />
    <br />
    The Crowes also credit visits and talks with Steve Bourdow, senior development officer, Baskin Engineering, who they said played a key role in engaging them with UCSC.<br />
    <br />
    The potential program reflects the Crowes' philosophy about growth and opportunities in college.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;At the end of the day, for both of our boys, and certainly for Jeremy, it is all about the connections you have with other people,&quot; Stephen Crowe said. &quot;In this case, he had such a terrific experience with faculty and other students.&quot;<br />
    <br />
    Giving to the UC system has become a family tradition for the Crowes. Prior to making their gift to UCSC, they did something similar for UC Santa Barbara, where their older son, Chris, received a degree in pharmacology in 2010.<br />
    <br />
    All this giving is part of what the Crowes have described as &quot;the second phase of our lives, to do some benefit for other people and get involved.&quot;<br />
    <br />
    The Crowes have strong ties with the UC system. Crowe himself is a graduate of UC Berkeley, and also received his MBA there. He also serves as an executive fellow at the Haas School of Business at Cal. His brother, sister-in-law, and niece all went to Berkeley, and they have family members with ties to UCLA and UCSF.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;The UC system offers a quality education, and we felt that part of our gifting in my retirement years would be in support of higher education,&quot; Crowe said. &quot;What better way to support UC than give to the campuses our sons attended.&quot;<br />
