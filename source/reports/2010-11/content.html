                <p>Jonathan Klein (Merrill '89, politics) and Alex Clemens (Porter '89, international politics) never met Gabriel Zimmerman, but they were moved to launch a scholarship campaign when they heard of his tragic death.</p>
                <p>&quot;In essence, I saw a young man doing what we would all hope people would do,&quot; Klein said. &quot;He was devoted to public service, and he got killed while he was doing what he loved. It hit me hard.&quot;</p>
                <p>It didn't take long for Klein and Clemens to mobilize supporters. &quot;We're Slugs,&quot; Clemens said. &quot;We know how to get this sort of stuff done.&quot;</p>
                <p>Klein, a lawyer specializing in labor and employment, and Clemens, founder of a communications strategy and advocacy group, used their career backgrounds to help get the word out, drawing from extensive connections in the legal and political realms.</p>
                <p>They are also part of the selection committee for the first scholarship fund recipient.</p>
                <p>The outpouring of response shows that UCSC is much more than a university filled with active students, alumni, faculty, and staff, Clemens said. &quot;We're also a community,&quot; he said. &quot;And a member of our community was taken away.&quot;</p>

                <h2> Never to be forgotten </h2>
                <p>Gabriel Zimmerman (Stevenson '02, sociology) was a hard-working community organizer with a strong sense of social justice and conflict resolution.</p>
                <p>On January 8, 2011, he was one of six people fatally injured in the shooting rampage at a Tucson, Ariz., &quot;Congress on Your Corner&quot; event that left his boss, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, seriously wounded. (Giffords is currently in rehabilitation.) He was 30.  </p>
                <p>News of Zimmerman's tragic death inspired an outpouring of support for UCSC's Gabriel Zimmerman Scholarship Fund, which commemorates the country's first congressional aide killed in the line of duty.</p>
                <p>The money will go to UCSC social sciences students who are in financial need and seeking careers in social justice or public service. The first award, $2,500, will be presented in April 2012. </p>
                <p>It only took two months to push the scholarship over the $50,000 level needed to launch an endowment fund.</p>
                <p>The power of social media became clear as supporters passed on word of this incident—and how others could help—through Facebook and Twitter.</p>
                <p>In mid-October the fund broke $75,000, with 540 donors, half of them alumni, contributing between $10 and $5,000.</p>
                <p>UCSC Social Sciences Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki said he could not think of a better way to honor Zimmerman's life while helping students follow in his footsteps.</p>
                <p>Zimmerman's mother, Emily Nottingham, is heartened by the widespread support.</p>
                <p>&quot;It was at UC Santa Cruz that Gabe really became interested in social justice, not just the political aspects but in the way people should think and treat one another, how they should be governed, or govern themselves,&quot; Nottingham said. &quot;UCSC is where he got his maturity, and his thinking about those issues.&quot;</p>
                <p>The campus was very important to Gabe, Nottingham continued. &quot;It's good that UCSC feels that he is part of their community because he certainly felt that way. The scholarship would have been very special to him. He would have been surprised, and particularly touched.&quot;</p>

                <h2>A legacy for Langdon</h2>
                <p>The Glen Langdon Prize will continue the legacy of an innovative thinker and beloved emeritus engineering professor at UCSC.</p>
                <p>Langdon is known for his work as an Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) engineer, and a creator of algorithms for data and image compression.</p>
                <p>He earned many patents for arithmetic coding and data compression.</p>
                <p>In 1987, Langdon joined UCSC's Computer Engineering Department, where he developed a model curriculum, still in use today. Students respected his intelligence, accessibility, and kindness.</p>
                <p>Today, Langdon struggles with Alzheimer's disease. His wife, Marian Langdon, said she is &quot;extremely gratified on Glen's behalf, and sorry he isn't in the position to understand the impact&quot; of this prize.</p>
                <p>&quot;I know how much he deserves this honor,&quot; she said.</p>
                <p>Dan McGuire—who launched the fundraising effort for the Langdon Prize with his $25,000 donation—was a college student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working at IBM Research Lab in San Jose, when Glen Langdon began to mentor him.</p>
                <p>Later, McGuire served on the UCSC faculty with Langdon, whom he describes as a &quot;wonderfully generous person who treated me like an equal.&quot;</p>
                <p>Supporters of this fund hope to raise a $250,000 endowment. Each year, prizes drawn from the interest will be awarded to promising incoming engineering graduate students affiliated with the IEEE.</p>

               <h5>Faculty lead by example</h5>
                <p>UCSC's Environmental Studies faculty believe the future's environmental problem-solvers must have immersive, hands-on learning. They know that students learn best when they leave the classroom behind and engage with the world.</p>

                <p>Demonstrating their commitment, all 16 of the department's faculty members donated to a campaign to raise funds for experiential learning programs.</p>
                <p>Faculty also made calls to alumni asking for pledges.</p>
                <p>&quot;Rather than succumb to pressures to have larger classes because of statewide budget cuts, the faculty decided to take it upon ourselves to raise the money and offer these classes long-term,&quot; said Karen Holl, professor and chair of the Environmental Studies Department, who pointed out that these courses require extra time and resources.</p>
                <p>The fundraiser began in earnest when Environmental Studies Professor Brent Haddad stood up at a faculty meeting and announced, &quot;I am going to donate $1,000.&quot;</p>
                <p>While Holl led the initiative, &quot;Brent helped set the bar for everybody else,&quot; she said.</p>
                <p>So far, faculty and alumni donors have raised $50,000 toward the endowment.</p>
                <p>They are aiming to raise an additional $150,000 in the next six months to meet a generous matching gift from an alumnus's family foundation.</p>
                <p>For information on the endowment or to donate, contact Jennifer Graham, senior director of development, Social Sciences, at <a href="mailto:jennifergraham@ucsc.edu">jennifergraham@ucsc.edu</a>, or<a href="https://envs.ucsc.edu/support-us" target="_top"> click here</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="headline">Commitment: Investments of the heart</h3>
                <h2>Faculty and staff invest in the place they love</h2>
                <p>UC Santa Cruz's faculty and staff have worked hard to make UCSC a renowned center for innovation, discovery, creativity, and instruction.</p>
                 <a href="images/leading-by-example-horiz.jpg" title="Faculty lead by example" rel="shadowbox"><img src="images/leading-by-example.jpg" alt="Faculty lead by example" border="0"/></a>
                <p>But their commitment to UCSC's future extends beyond the classroom and their day-to-day responsibilities. Within the last three years, these members of the UCSC community have given or pledged $3.3 million.</p>

                <p>Within the last decade, they've given more than $8 million. All-time contributions since the campus's founding in 1965 add up to $14 million.</p>
                <p>Recent numbers show that faculty and staff have become even more generous over time. Contributions to UCSC have gone up within the past decade, with a dramatic increase over the last three years, in spite of the economic downturn. In doing so, these UCSC community members have helped preserve some of the campus's best-loved traditions, including scholarships, research, and public outreach.</p>
                <p>This list of donations includes current and former faculty and staff contributions.</p>
                <p>By far, the most popular category for contributions is &quot;other purposes&quot;—which includes UCSC's libraries, the Arboretum, KZSC, friends groups, UCSC Extension, and campus art galleries. Current faculty members also tend to support research heavily.</p>
                <p>&quot;At a time of diminishing state support for the university, faculty and staff have done more than make the campus one of the world's preeminent research and teaching institutions,&quot; UCSC Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway said. &quot;They're increasingly giving financial support, too. That's quite a strong statement to make, especially during these times of economic uncertainty.&quot;</p>

                <h2>Hellman family bestows boost for research</h2>
                <p>Established in 2011 with a $625,000 gift to UCSC, the Hellman Fellows Program provides a substantial boost for talented junior faculty members who need research project funding.</p>
                <p>The Hellman family established the program in 1994 after observing that junior faculty members are often well-funded when first hired, but face challenges that arise in two to three years when start-up funding is exhausted and before first grants are obtained. </p>
                <p>The program now supports junior faculty at 13 institutions including nine UC campuses. </p>
                <p>The first 12 Hellman Fellows awards at UCSC were announced this year.  The recipients have a wide range of research areas from film and digital media to economics, literature, anthropology, and physical and biological sciences. Assistant Professor John Jota Leaños, film and digital media, is at work on &quot;Frontera!&quot; his vividly animated histories of the Southwest borderlands, while another assistant professor, Victoria Auerbuch Stone, microbiology and environmental toxicology, is working on &quot;Germ warfare: How Yersinia manipulates its host.&quot; </p>
                <p>&quot;We think the faculty we choose for awards all have very exciting projects,&quot; said UCSC Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Herbert Lee. Lee added that the research quality is the most important criterion for selection. </p>
                <p>Private equity investor Warren Hellman calls the program &quot;one of the best things my family has ever done with our giving.&quot; </p>
                <p>For information about the Hellman Fellows Program at UCSC, contact Herbert Lee, vice provost for Academic Affairs and campus diversity officer for faculty, at <a href="mailto:vpaa@ucsc.edu">vpaa@ucsc.edu</a>.

                <h2>Parents make the difference</h2>
                <p>Bryan and Susan Lovegren, proud members of the Chancellor's Associates giving society, started giving to UCSC when their son Brad (Stevenson '12, environmental studies) was a freshman.</p>
                <p>Susan Lovegren, vice president of human resources for a networking company in Sunnyvale, was impressed by &quot;the thoughtful debate of ideas&quot; that took place in her son's Freshman Core Curriculum, along with the generosity and authenticity of professors and administrators, and the campus's tangible sense of community.</p>

                <p>The Lovegrens' funding priorities include longer library hours, writing tutors, scholarships, and research in the sciences.</p>
                <p>Their giving to UCSC feels personal. Their son's experiences on campus have changed the way he interprets the world and made him more confident, they say.</p>
                <p>The state budget crisis has increased the urgency behind their giving. &quot;We heard the numbers: $750 million in cuts across the UC campuses,&quot; said Bryan Lovegren, research services manager for a Santa Clara-based measurement company. &quot;Our reaction was, 'Wow, that's a lot.'&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;We felt we wanted to do as much as we could because of our connection to UCSC,&quot; Susan Lovegren said.</p>
                <p>

                <h3 class="headline">The impact of a strong university</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Chancellor's Associates member Ceil Cirillo has contributed nearly $6,000 to UCSC since she arrived in the area more than 20 years ago.</p>
                <p>Cirillo, the retired City of Santa Cruz Economic Development and Redevelopment director, helped facilitate the rebuilding of the downtown after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. She believes UCSC is an essential part of Santa Cruz's lasting vitality.</p>
                <p> &quot;I have an enormous respect for the leadership and functions that come out of UCSC,&quot; said Cirillo, who has given to many university causes including Shakespeare Santa Cruz, scholarships, the Long Marine Laboratory, and the Women's Club.</p>
                <p>She said that the groundbreaking research at UCSC makes her proud to be associated with UCSC and to live in the area. Cirillo is a fixture at UCSC community events ranging from Founders Celebrations to the annual Scholarship Benefit Dinner.</p>
                <p>&quot;I give morally, financially, and promotionally,&quot; Cirillo said. &quot;I promote the university because of the value it provides to our area.&quot; </p>
                <p>

                <h3 class="headline">Supporting world-class sophistication</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Doug Ley, the managing partner of Redtree Properties, a Santa Cruz-based commercial investment company, is proud to be carrying on a family tradition of giving to UCSC.</p>
                <p>The Ley family is the majority owner of Redtree, which contributed more than $11,000 to UCSC in 2010, much of it to community outreach, but also to the UCSC Chancellor's Fund.</p>
                <p>Doug Ley himself made the funding decision and directed the giving. In doing so, he's continuing a Ley family legacy. His father, Leslie Ley, was chairman of the board for the UC Santa Cruz Foundation from 1983 to 1985. His mother, Jeane Ley, established an annual award that continues to help UCSC students with on-campus childcare expenses.</p>
                <p>&quot;UCSC is the best thing that has ever happened to Santa Cruz,&quot; Ley said. &quot;It's more than just the biggest employer in the area. Its presence makes Santa Cruz a more attractive place for people to live and work. It brings the sophistication of a world-class university.&quot;</p>
                <p>Ley supports the Chancellor's Fund &quot;because we've got a great chancellor here, George Blumenthal. Budget times are tough, so you try to give him the resources he needs.&quot;</p>
                <p>Ley's causes include Shakespeare Santa Cruz, so he was thrilled to hear Blumenthal announce that the Chancellor's Office would commit $30,000 to a <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2011/10/review-fall-2011-philanthropy.html" target="_top">challenge-match fundraiser</a> for the professional theater company. Three external donors—Carolyn Hyatt, Karen Sinsheimer, and Audrey Stanley—put up $70,000 for the match.</p>
