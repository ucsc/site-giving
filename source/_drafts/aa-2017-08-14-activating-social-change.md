Marginalized perspectives often come to the forefront of research at UC Santa Cruz. Luckily, there are donors who support this ethos. A **new faculty chair** is helping ensure that feminism will not be a fringe view, but instead a mainstay of the humanities. A grant from the Mellon Foundation kicked off the speaker series **_Non-citizenship_**, addressing global issues shaped by the movement of refugees, immigrants, and guest workers. An endowed chair and funding for the **Everett Program** supports a student-run information management program that uses technology and ingenuity to amplify communications from distant lands. The naming honors Dorothy Everett, a UC employee who devoted her life to student success. Because of donor support history students with the **Gail Project** will journey to another corner of the world, guided by an Army of officer’s black- and-white photos from the 1950s, to collect stories from Okinawans affected by the U.S. Army occupation. When those who have been silenced are able to speak up, the path toward social justice becomes clearer to navigate.

_Key support provided by Mark Headley (Stevenson &#8217;83, economics and politics), and Christina Pehl, the Peggy and Jack Baskin Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the Andromeda Foundation._
