Proud parents Stephen and Linda Crowe were looking for a meaningful and enduring way to honor their son, Jeremy, a fourth-year undergraduate student in UCSC&#8217;s computer science program.

They wanted to acknowledge his studies and his strong performance, while also giving a boost to the program itself.

Crowe, a new [UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee](/about/trustees/#crowe) and a retired vice president of finance and CFO of Chevron Corporation, found a way to achieve both goals: He and Linda are giving $100,000 in unrestricted funds to UCSC&#8217;s Computer Engineering Department to help other students have the transformative experiences Jeremy had.

The gift stemmed in part from Crowe&#8217;s visits with UCSC Computer Science Department Chair Jim Whitehead. &#8220;What a terrific guy,&#8221; Crowe said. Together they hashed out some possible goals for the unrestricted funds, including a program that could bring guest lecturers &#8220;over the hill&#8221; from Silicon Valley to teach computer science courses, building bridges with the tech industry while adding an extra dose of real-world heft to the classroom experience.

The Crowes also credit visits and talks with Steve Bourdow, senior development officer, Baskin Engineering, who they said played a key role in engaging them with UCSC.

The potential program reflects the Crowes&#8217; philosophy about growth and opportunities in college.

&#8220;At the end of the day, for both of our boys, and certainly for Jeremy, it is all about the connections you have with other people,&#8221; Stephen Crowe said. &#8220;In this case, he had such a terrific experience with faculty and other students.&#8221;

Giving to the UC system has become a family tradition for the Crowes. Prior to making their gift to UCSC, they did something similar for UC Santa Barbara, where their older son, Chris, received a degree in pharmacology in 2010.

All this giving is part of what the Crowes have described as &#8220;the second phase of our lives, to do some benefit for other people and get involved.&#8221;

The Crowes have strong ties with the UC system. Crowe himself is a graduate of UC Berkeley, and also received his MBA there. He also serves as an executive fellow at the Haas School of Business at Cal. His brother, sister-in-law, and niece all went to Berkeley, and they have family members with ties to UCLA and UCSF.

&#8220;The UC system offers a quality education, and we felt that part of our gifting in my retirement years would be in support of higher education,&#8221; Crowe said. &#8220;What better way to support UC than give to the campuses our sons attended.&#8221;
