Stella Wilson-Frey didn’t much care for high school. She took the state proficiency exam and enrolled at Cabrillo College at 16. But she still wasn’t very interested in school. A self-financed trip to London altered her perceptions. She decided to work hard in school so she could qualify to study abroad.

She is the 2010-11 Santa Cruz Seaside Scholarship recipient, a $2,500 award. Previously, Wilson-Frey—the youngest of 10 children—had to work full-time while going to school, but now she can focus solely on her course work.

“I can see now that education can help you accomplish what you want in life,” said Wilson-Frey.
