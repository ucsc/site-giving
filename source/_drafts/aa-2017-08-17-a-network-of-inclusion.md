As California becomes more diverse, so do UC Santa Cruz students—including more than a third from families in which neither parent has a four-year college degree. Donors are working to ensure that opportunities to succeed in the sciences, arts, politics, and society are available to all regardless of circumstances. The **Academic Excellence Program**, **Lamat**, **Summer Research Experience**, and **Summer Research Institute** are giving students experiences that might otherwise have been out of reach. **Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students** (STARS) supports those transferring from community or other colleges, re-entry students, military veterans, and student parents. The **Doris Duke Conservation Scholars** program brings 20 underrepresented students a year to campus to experience hands-on conservation research and leadership opportunities. **The Dreamweavers Fund** provides aid and scholarships for young undocumented immigrants, while the **Smith Renaissance Society** supports students who lack traditional familial support. Ensuring a welcoming place and services for LGBTQ students, a bequest will provide an endowment for the **Lionel Cantú Queer Center**. Students from the Central Valley and Compton High School in LA have access to special scholarships. And the new **Koret Undergraduate Research Scholarships** are awarded to scores of students regardless of discipline—ensuring opportunities whatever their backgrounds or majors.
