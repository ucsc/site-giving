&#8220;It was a great honor just to be selected, such a surprise and such a nice one,&#8221; said Skye Vendt-Pearce, recipient of an Amy Beth Snader Memorial Scholarship. Vendt-Pearce, an electrical engineering major used the scholarship funds to purchase a laptop. &#8220;It has been awesome to be mobile with my studies,&#8221; she said.

Snader Scholarships are awarded to women in engineering on the basis of merit. The fund, which was established by Barbara Snader in memory of her daughter Amy (Merrill &#8217;83), is primarily funded through a planned gift. Amy Snader earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in computer science and went on to a highly successful career as a software engineer.

&#8220;I feel that the work I have done in the Baskin School of Engineering has definitely prepared me for life in the &#8216;real world&#8217; of the profession,&#8221; said Vendt-Pearce, who already has the experience to prove it. Two years ago she started working during summer and winter breaks for a large electrical contracting firm in San Jose that designs systems for residential, commercial, and educational buildings. &#8220;I really like the company and industry I&#8217;m in. I feel like I&#8217;m starting on my career right when I graduate,&#8221; said Vendt-Pearce, who has already lined up a full-time job with the firm and is planning to work toward a professional engineer&#8217;s license.

An accomplished athlete who grew up in Sonoma, Vendt-Pearce was primarily attracted to UC Santa Cruz by two factors: the electrical engineering major and the soccer program. The Cowell College student found the campus a perfect fit. &#8220;I think electrical engineering is a great program, with lots of faculty interaction and opportunities to collaborate with your classmates, and that&#8217;s a great way to learn,&#8221; she said. In addition to undertaking the rigorous electrical engineering major, she participated in the Education Abroad Program, studying electronics at the University of Kent in England.

Although Vendt-Pearce noticed there were often few women in her classes, she never felt out of place. &#8220;I really appreciate the scholarship donors&#8217; dedication to provide opportunities for women in engineering,&#8221; she said. &#8220;With more scholarships like these, hopefully the number of women engineers will increase.&#8221;
