Alper, who worked at McHenry Library for eight years, was killed in 2013 while biking on Highway 1 north of Santa Cruz.

Known for his humor, kindness, and generosity, Alper (Stevenson &#8217;98, literature) began work in the University Library in 2005. He was also a musician and a budding philanthropist.

Alper&#8217;s parents, Ted and Marsha Alper, and a group of his friends have come forward with a large contribution to establish the Joshua Alper-Marines Foundation in his memory.

Marsha Alper said her son was &#8220;a citizen of UC Santa Cruz, and Santa Cruz in general. You couldn&#8217;t walk down the street without someone stopping him. He was very well loved.&#8221;

The fund will be geared especially toward Stevenson work-study students at McHenry, though Alper&#8217;s parents said it would benefit students regardless of their college affiliation.
