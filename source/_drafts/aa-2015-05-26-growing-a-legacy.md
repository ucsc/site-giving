While Naraghi&#8217;s father mostly employed conventional farming methods, he used water-conserving irrigation techniques from his native Iran, and set aside 10 acres that were completely organic, with Persian grapes, fruits, and vegetables.

&#8220;My whole life was going down to the orchard,&#8221; Naraghi recalled. &#8220;I can still smell the produce and the soil.&#8221;

Naraghi, who grows almonds, pistachios, walnuts, and pomegranates, has become a passionate supporter of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS). Giving to UC Santa Cruz has helped firm up her emotional connection to Santa Cruz, where she has vacationed since childhood. It&#8217;s also a way to remember her late father&#8217;s interest in organic farming.

&#8220;I know he is happy that I&#8217;m doing as much as I can,&#8221; she said.
