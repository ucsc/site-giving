Part of what sets UC Santa Cruz apart is our commitment to the quality of experience undergraduates receive. For many that promise would be out of reach without scholarships supported by generous donors. For some donors, scholarships represent a way to enrich their community.

These students benefit from a scholarship supporter who wished to provide for those who, like him, grew up in a particular region of the San Joaquin Valley including Tulare and Kings county. Regardless of the structure, the outcome is gratitude from dedicated students taking full advantage of newly opened doors.
