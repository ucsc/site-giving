UC Santa Cruz Dean of the Arts David Yager made quite an impression on investor Youri Bujko and his wife Luciana Andrade during an alumni award ceremony at West Hollywood&#8217;s Soho House last year.

&#8220;Dean Yager brings incredible innovation to the public education system,&#8221; said Bujko, who owns Thalassa Capital LLC, an investment company in Santa Monica. &#8220;We just love the way he promotes UC Santa Cruz, as well as his fundraising innovation.&#8221;

In fact, Yager so impressed Bujko and Andrade that they pledged $50,000 to the fund for Arts Excellence to increase internship and mentoring opportunities as well as help underprivileged students study the arts at UC Santa Cruz.

Andrade&#8217;s son, Lucas Bonetti, will start at UC Santa Cruz this fall, pursuing a masters in social documentary.

The couple&#8217;s giving reflects their key conviction that &#8220;the component to the success of a nation is making sure that those who have the least still have access to a great education.&#8221;
