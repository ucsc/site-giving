When you support UC Santa Cruz, you are investing in an extraordinary place. We are committed to transformative education and high-impact research that makes the world a better place.

An undergraduate degree from UC Santa Cruz means something intrinsically different than a degree from anywhere else. Our students experience real-world, hands-on learning, and they understand how to question the status quo in ways that lead them to fulfilling, meaningful careers and lives. We stand for the right things and ask tough questions of ourselves and of others. Our research has changed the world’s understanding of the human genome, of deep space, of the human psyche, of art’s ability to create change, of history’s lessons.

We invite your partnership in these great undertakings!
