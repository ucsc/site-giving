All UC Santa Cruz students are part of both a prestigious university and a college â€“ one of ten communities that provide an academic home, residential life, and social connection. The college structure is designed to combine the intimacy of a small, liberal arts college with the depth and rigor of a major research university.

Each college is seeking support for its innovative programs and initiatives that serve students and push the boundaries of knowledge and understanding.
