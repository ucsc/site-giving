Faculty chairs and other research support is key to attracting and retaining world-class faculty. Our faculty are among the most cited researchers in the world. They teach and collaborate with students, conducting investigation at the forefront of their fields. We invite you to support them with immediate use funds and endowments. Funds for strategic use in faculty recruitment and retention are a key resource for the chancellor and in each academic division.

### Opportunities to support faculty in the Office of the Chancellor and each academic division include:

  * **Endowed faculty chairs:** $1 million and up
  * **Immediate use research support:** $25,000 and up
  * **Chancellor’s Faculty Recruitment Fund:** $5,000 and up
  * **Dean’s Excellence funds:** Gifts of any size
