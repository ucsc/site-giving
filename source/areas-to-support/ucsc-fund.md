## YES is a powerful gift.
{% include sidebars/{{page.sidebar1}} classes="right" %}
_**By making a gift to the UCSC Fund, you allow us to say yes.**_

This is the most flexible kind of support you can give us, because these funds go to initiatives that will benefit immediately from extra financial help.

### With your help, last year we said yes to:

  * Funding the Chancellorâ€™s Undergraduate Internship Program
  * Funding athletics
  * Funding student-organized events and clubs

**Be the difference** in the life of a student. Every gift, of any size, is profound.
