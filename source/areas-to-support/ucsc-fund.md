## YES

### With your help, last year we said yes to:

**Be the difference** in the life of a student. Every gift, of any size, is profound.

### A Gift of $1,000 qualifies you as a Chancellor’s Associate.

Share the campus vision of education, public service, and research. Gifts to this fund allow the Chancellor’s Office the flexibility to support top priorities that continue the values that have made us independent, nimble, and visionary.
