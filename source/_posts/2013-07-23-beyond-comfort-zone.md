Ask Josh Katz about his experiences at UC Santa Cruz and the 21-year-old art and psychology major will say it&#8217;s all about pushing himself out of his comfort zone.

First, a psychology class gave the Porter College student such &#8220;rich insight&#8221; into human behavior, he said, he was able to use that knowledge to drive himself to be more comfortable in his own skin.

Then came a $700 Irwin Project Grant, which funds student art projects on campus. The grant allowed Katz to expand out from the street-inspired stencil and spray paint he normally used to media that included hand-colored, brightly hued waxes.

&#8220;I got inspired and launched a new trajectory of art-making,&#8221; Katz said.

Finally, Katz pushed his boundaries with a five-month course of study in the Netherlands through UCSC&#8217;s Education Abroad Program. In the Netherlands, he not only has made friends with people from around the world, but also has learned to be confident in presentation-based classes, raised about $1,600 to help an Ethiopian school get needed supplies, and even hitchhiked to Berlin once.

&#8220;Berlin is covered in murals. It&#8217;s phenomenal,&#8221; said Katz, who found inspiration for his own art during his visit to the capital city.

The Irwin Grant and UCSC&#8217;s travel-study program, said Katz, &#8220;have been the most wonderful part of my education at UCSC.&#8221;

When Katz graduates in 2015 he plans to move himself out of his comfort zone even further. He wants to create a socially conscious clothing company that will feature his music- and street-inspired art.

&#8220;It&#8217;s clothing you want to take out for a night,&#8221; he said, describing his vision of brightly colored, conceptual apparel.

Add Katz&#8217;s desire to have his clothes produced with environmentally friendly and fair labor practices, and also benefit a charity, and that&#8217;s pushing a boundary even more.
