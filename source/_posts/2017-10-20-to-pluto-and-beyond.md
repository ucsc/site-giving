An undergraduate student at UC Santa Cruz has expanded our knowledge of Pluto—and gotten a boost toward a career with the help of UC Santa Cruz donors.

In 2015 when the [_New Horizons_ space probe](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html) flew close by Pluto, it photographed strange pits in part of the frozen nitrogen and methane of the dwarf planet’s surface.

“They kind of stretch out, and they’re clumped together in some spots,” says Nadim Abu-Hashmeh (Oakes ‘17, Earth sciences). “There aren’t any features that look quite like this in the solar system.”

Professor Francis Nimmo, a member of the team studying the _New Horizons_ data, invited Abu-Hashmeh to test a popular explanation for the pits. The hypothesis was that they formed from sublimation, the ice evaporating when warmed by sunlight.

So he mapped the pits, building a big data file. He programmed a computer to model changes in their shape. In his simulation, the slope of the pit that is lit with sunlight sublimates away while the ice of the shaded slope slides in. The simulation produced shapes like the pits on Pluto. And something else: In the model the pits move.

“So a lot of these pits may have not formed in the spot that we’re seeing them now,” he says. “That’s a pretty exciting finding.”

Abu-Hashmeh is determined to start a career in planetary science. But he will take a short break from his preparations for grad school this fall. With financial assistance from the Endowment for Undergraduate Research in Science and Technology, he will present his findings to fellow planetary scientists at the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans.

“The endowment is going to help me get myself out there,” Abu-Hashmeh says. “I will show the research I’ve done and open new pathways for the future.”

[Contributions to the Endowment for Undergraduate Research in Science and Technology](https://crowdfund.ucsc.edu/?cfpage=project&project_id=17079) are currently being doubled or even tripled thanks to a $100,000 matching gift from the Hierarchical Systems Research Foundation.
