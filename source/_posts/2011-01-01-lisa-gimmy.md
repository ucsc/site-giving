&#8220;When I look back on my educational experience at UC Santa Cruz, it seems in retrospect like a golden age of opportunity and abundance,&#8221; said Lisa Gimmy, (Cowell &#8217;77), who supports undergraduate scholarships through the Telephone Outreach Program. &#8220;When the student callers contact me and they&#8217;re asking for donations, and they explain what they go through now and you compare it to what you were offered, your heart just goes out to them.&#8221;

Gimmy entered UCSC intending to major in science, but a class with pioneer faculty art professor Jasper Rose changed the direction of her studies. &#8220;It was the first time in my life I&#8217;d ever met somebody who was able to make connections across different disciplines and see things in a very unified way,&#8221; said Gimmy, who graduated with a degree in art history and went on to graduate studies at Harvard University, then combined her interest in science with art to create a career as an award-winning landscape architect.

&#8220;UC Santa Cruz provides a truly collegiate, as opposed to competitive, atmosphere of learning,&#8221; said Gimmy, who both remains friends with classmates from her undergraduate years and has expanded her circle of UC Santa Cruz friends through attending regional alumni events. &#8220;It was the first time in my life that I was in an environment that was completely filled with people who loved learning and were excited by almost everything around them.&#8221;
