Honoring those who lives exemplified the best of UC Santa Cruz inspired the creation of scholarships, student awards, and memorials in their names. Families, friends, colleagues, and others gave generously to commemorate those legacies. Among the many honored were some whose lives were cut tragically short, including **Annais Rittenberg** (Porter), aspiring environmental studies major; **Gabriel Zimmerman** (Stevenson ’02, sociology), congressional aide; **Elizabeth Butler** (Kresge, ’96, community studies), Santa Cruz police officer; **Josh Alper** (Stevenson ’00, literature), staff librarian; **Terry Freitas** (Crown ’97, environmental studies, biology), social and ecological activist; **Clare Wedding** (Porter ’09, history of art and visual culture), Oceania specialist; **Kenneth Gram** (Kresge ’09, literature), writer; and **Gordon Smith** (Rachel Carson ’86, mathematics), retired staff at Long Marine Lab. Others whose lives were honored include **Don Rothman**, writing instructor; **Mary Katherine Long**, mentor to students; **Bruce Lane**, project architect; **Mary Zavanelli** (Graduate Division ’91, Ph.D. biology), biology lecturer; **Aaronette White**, psychology professor; **Rita Pister**, chancellor’s associate and student advocate; and **Sophía García- Robles**, financial aid of officer.
