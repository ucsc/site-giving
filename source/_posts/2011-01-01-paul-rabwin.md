<figcaption>Television producer Paul Rabwin (Cowell &#8217;70) at his home in Los Angeles.</figcaption></figure> 
A &#8220;pioneer alumnus,&#8221; Rabwin helped to literally create performing arts programs at UC Santa Cruz. Founder of the Cowell Madrigal Singers and composer for many University Theater Productions, he and his classmates remodeled a Cowell Ranch building at the base of campus into the Barn Theater, one of the first performing arts venues at UC Santa Cruz. &#8220;I was given tremendous opportunities because there were no ongoing or even existing performing arts programs at the time,&#8221; said Rabwin. &#8220;So my classmates and I did all this wonderful, creative work that I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do otherwise. I want to ensure that those opportunities continue at Santa Cruz.&#8221;

The relationships Rabwin formed with faculty and classmates have also helped to shape his life. &#8220;I think the support group that has been created among the alumni is very critical,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s important for new students and their parents to know it&#8217;s there, and that that&#8217;s part of the UCSC experience as well.&#8221;

As a producer, Rabwin has directed second unit crews responsible for shooting sequences not involving main actors; produced special effects for the entire X-Files series; and supervised post production on four television series simultaneously. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any question that the type of educational environment that I experienced motivated me to seek out a similar, creative environment in my life&#8217;s work,&#8221; said Rabwin. &#8220;I liked the combination of structure and self-motivational direction that I was given at UC Santa Cruz, and it turned out to be important in my field.&#8221;
