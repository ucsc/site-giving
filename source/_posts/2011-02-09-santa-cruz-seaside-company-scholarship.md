&#8220;To be able to create a scholarship for local students studying at UC Santa Cruz is something I&#8217;m very proud of,&#8221; said Charles Canfield, president of the Santa Cruz Seaside Company and owner and operator of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk since 1984. &#8220;I want to help ensure that future generations of local students are able to pursue their dreams through education.&#8221;

The Santa Cruz Seaside Company Scholarship will give preference each year to a UCSC student who has graduated from Cabrillo College and who is also a graduate of a Santa Cruz County high school. Established with a $50,000 gift, the award will provide a $2,000 need-based scholarship. Scholarship amounts will increase as the fund continues to grow.

Canfield, a Santa Cruz County high school alumnus, has a strong belief in the power of education and the importance of giving back to the community. &#8220;My family has been living and working in Santa Cruz for generations and the Canfield family has been involved with the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk since the 1930s,&#8221; said Canfield. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been working here since I was 16 years old.&#8221;

The Seaside Company, which employs approximately 1,600 people during the summer season, already provides $500 college scholarships to 12 company employees studying at various institutions. Many employees are graduates of local high schools and have studied at Cabrillo College and UCSC.
