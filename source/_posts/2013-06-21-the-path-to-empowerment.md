Xochitl Rios&#8217;s father left school in fourth grade, coaxing a living out of the soil. Her mother, who had a third-grade education, raised 12 children in their small village in Central Mexico.

Today, Rios (Oakes &#8217;13) is a UC Santa Cruz student majoring in chemistry with plans to go to graduate school. A U.S. citizen now, she wants to work in pharmaceutical research.

When she won a Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Award, she knew she was taking the next step toward a career.

&#8220;That scholarship meant everything to me,&#8221; she said.

Rios came to the U.S. at 15 and enrolled in high school. But the death of her father forced her into full-time work to help support her family. Then, two things happened.

The first event was fortunate. She got a green card.

The second was tragic. Her favorite sister, Lucy, was diagnosed with liver cancer and given six months to live.

&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have any money to help her,&#8221; said Rios. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have any knowledge. I promised myself I that would go back to school and, if anyone else in my family had an emergency, I would be able to contribute with science, with knowledge, and with money.&#8221;
