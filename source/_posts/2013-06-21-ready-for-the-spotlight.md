The African American Theater Arts Troupe does more than put on heart-stirring performances at UCSC.

It raises cultural awareness throughout the region, and has awarded more than $85,000 in scholarships to students involved with the troupe.

Now celebrating its 20th year, the troupe—the only one of its kind in the UC system—improves retention rates among African-American students while attracting prospective students with statewide outreach. So far, 1,000 students have taken part in A.A.T.A.T. productions. But all of this hard work cannot take place without strong public support.

Now the troupe is hoping to build its current $14,000 endowment to $100,000 within the next 10 years to help sustain its rich life far into the future.

The troupe receives funds from Measure 49, which supports the organization with student fees. It also relies on community partnerships and private funding to support productions that cost up to $8,000 to put on.

The troupe is known for its skillful actors—all the more remarkable considering they are mostly non-theater arts majors performing plays that illustrate the African American experience, including works by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright August Wilson. In fact, the troupe includes significant numbers of biochemistry majors.

Ticket sales, donations, and community partnerships support the troupe.

&#8220;Whether it is $1 or $50, it makes a big difference,&#8221; said troupe director and founder Don Williams. &#8220;I&#8217;ve even heard students say, &#8216;If not for this troupe, I would not be here.&#8217; They say, &#8216;The troupe caused me to stay. It helped me find myself and where to fit in.'&#8221;

One strong supporter is Michael McCawley, UCSC&#8217;s director of admissions. &#8220;The troupe is a real treasure. I think the work Don Williams has done is miraculous.&#8221;

Another supporter, Campus Provost Alison Galloway, said the A.A.T.A.T. is, if anything, more important than ever at a time when a poor economy makes it increasingly difficult for students from underrepresented groups who are interested in attending UC.

&#8220;The troupe&#8217;s outreach is vitally important—by helping prospective students see themselves on stage, the A.A.T.A.T. also helps them see themselves as UCSC students,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was very proud to promise to personally match a portion of funds that A.A.T.A.T. raised during a recent request for donations.&#8221;
