Parents Ken and Marian Brown are loyal supporters of UCSC, and they continue to recognize the campus with their generosity even though their daughter, Monica Brown, graduated 17 years ago.  
Monica (Stevenson &#8217;95, literature [creative writing] and psychology) is now senior director of marketing for [LeapFrog](http://www.leapfrog.com/en-us/home), an educational company in Emeryville that makes toys, kids&#8217; learning tablets, and games.

The Browns said Monica&#8217;s UCSC experience created a template for her life. Monica is also now a contributor to the university.

&#8220;UCSC certainly provided a basis for Monica&#8217;s later success, in her first job, then as valedictorian of her MBA class at UC Berkeley, and in her current work at Leapfrog,&#8221; Marian Brown said. &#8220;It makes sense to us to continue to support the school that gave our daughter such a good foundation.&#8221;

The parents also give to UCSC to show their commitment &#8220;to the multiple benefits for all the people of California of a strong public higher education system. The education and the research bring good jobs, prosperity, and more knowledgeable citizens.&#8221;

The UC system remains excellent, but it can&#8217;t do all it&#8217;s capable of because of the state&#8217;s lack of funds.

&#8220;So we also continue to support UC Santa Cruz to help strengthen a vital educational institution for the well-being of Californians and our state,&#8221; continued the Browns.

As ardent backers of the university, the Browns keep track of goings-on at UCSC by reading campus newsletters and attending university programs.

&#8220;We&#8217;re impressed with the new developments and research being done by faculty and students,&#8221; Ken Brown said. &#8220;We like the fact that Santa Cruz fosters a close collaboration between different disciplines. Educational and research work like that done at Santa Cruz will help California retain its unique character and promise for the future.&#8221;
