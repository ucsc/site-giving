The reopening of the iconic and beloved **Quarry Amphitheater**, closed since 2006, took a village. It took a **partnership among students**—who committed millions in already collected fees toward the project—**campus leaders, alumni, and friends** of the university who supported the project with their philanthropy. Among the first donors to step forward: alumnus William Hancock (Cowell ’79). He, like many others, had memories of great experiences in the Quarry and wanted those to be part of the student experience again. With rebuilt seating, upgrades to the stage, a new power infrastructure, improved access and safety, and WiFi access, the Quarry is reopening in fall 2017. It will serve again as a center for the campus’s diversity of artistic and intellectual expression, performances, ceremonies, and spontaneous gatherings. And it will act, as it did beginning in 1966, as a powerful connection for the campus to its history and natural landscape.

_Key support provided by students and by donors, including William Hancock (Cowell &#8217;79, environmental planning), George Kraw (Stevenson &#8217;83, economics, politics), Alison Galloway, Mark Headley and Christina Pehl, Joanna Miller, Tom Akin (Cowell &#8217;74, biology), and hundreds of others._
