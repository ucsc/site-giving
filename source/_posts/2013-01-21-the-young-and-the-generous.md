The Senior Fund is a student-initiated, student-funded, and student-controlled giving fund started by the Class of 2010. It&#8217;s all part of the spirit of giving, which is inspiring members of the UCSC community even before they graduate.

&#8220;The idea behind the Senior Legacy Fund is simple but powerful, &#8216; said Emilie Winfield, student giving outreach intern. &#8220;Money from students goes directly to other students. Students can choose exactly where the money goes. And it&#8217;s not just undergraduates. Parents, students, faculty—anyone can give to the fund.&#8221;

Even better, the program accepts gifts of all sizes, with a minimum of $10. However the students are encouraged to give $20.13 in honor of their class year.

&#8220;Every dollar makes a difference,&#8221; said Kresge student Hannah Klass, a fundraiser for student philanthropy organization Slug 2 Slug and the Class of 2013. &#8220;We&#8217;re fundraising for a good cause, and if we stick to it all year I definitely think we&#8217;ll hit our goals.&#8221;

Aside from fundraising, the Class of 2013 fosters pride and unity—and a strong sense of fun—through events, class T-shirts, and monthly meetings to bring UCSC seniors together.

&#8220;This program helps to cultivate the next generation of philanthropic leaders,&#8221; said Class of 2013 staff advisor Shayna Kent. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to support students, and eventually young alumni, who are going to stay connected to UCSC and continue to give back after they graduate.&#8221;

To UCSC students, the Banana Slug is more than just the mascot of the university; it&#8217;s also an emblem of giving.

&#8220;As a UCSC student, I am a representative of the institution and the values for which the Banana Slug stands,&#8221; said Senior Legacy Scholarship winner Hilary Van Hoose (Porter &#8217;13, film and digital media). &#8220;My actions, my very presence at this school, influence what the term &#8216;Banana Slug&#8217; will mean to future generations of students.&#8221;
