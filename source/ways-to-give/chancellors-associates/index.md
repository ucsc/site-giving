Chancellor’s Associates are UC Santa Cruz’s leadership annual giving community. Chancellor’s Associates provide consistent support that is critical to our success as a world-class higher learning institution. Chancellor’s Associates welcomes alumni, parents, faculty, staff, and friends as generous campus partners. Year after year, donors who make leadership gifts as a Chancellor’s Associate bridge the gap between endowed scholarships and other sources of financial aid. This annual commitment enables transformative change and inspires others to give back.

**Chancellor’s Associates begins with an annual gift to any area, college, department, or program in the amount of $2,500 or more.** We recognize that young alumni are at the start of a dynamic and exciting time of their lives; we welcome graduates of the last decade (GOLD) to Chancellor’s Associates with an annual gift of $500 or more.

Being a Chancellor’s Associate means engaging in meaningful ways across campus in the areas  donors are most passionate about.  Our students, faculty, research, programs, facilities, and community as a whole benefit greatly from this special and loyal group of supporters. **As a member of the giving community, donor courtesies include:**

- Exclusive communications from our chancellor and campus leaders    
- Invitations to unique donor events:
  - Invitation to attend the UC Santa Cruz’s “Culinary Challenge” celebrating the UCSC Dining Team, up to two guests   
	- Invitation to attend the Dickens Universe Friday night auction and Victorian dance
	- Reserved balcony seating (elevator access) at the West Field House for the Men’s and Women’s Basketball and Volleyball games, upon request
