The chancellor invests the UC Santa Cruz Fund and the Parents Fund where they will have the greatest impact. Here are some of the ways the funds are invested:

## Internships

The Chancellor&#8217;s Undergraduate Internship Program pairs competitively selected students with faculty in leadership seminar classes and in internships across campus. Among internships:

  * **The Good Neighbor Initiative:** Students work with campus neighbors on issues important to the community.
  * **Student Veterans:** Supports recruitment and retention of military veteran students
  * **Campus Sustainability Education and Outreach:** Promotes campaigns to conserve resources

## Student groups

More than 150 student-led organizations count on Student Organization Advising & Resources for support in creating a culturally enriched environment. Among the breadth of organizations:

  * **Rotaract:** Rotary-sponsored club based on campus that engages young men and women in public service.
  * **The African American Theater Arts Troupe:** Culturally inclusive student-run performance group.
  * **City on a Hill Press:** Weekly student newspaper published in print and online.

## Excellence across campus

Academic innovation benefits from strategic support in a range of areas, including:

  * Funding for promising research projects
  * Seed funding for innovative programs in the Colleges
  * Extending hours of operation at McHenry Library
  * Supporting intercollegiate athletics
