Donors who give $1,000 or more annually to one of two discretionary funds—the UC Santa Cruz Fund or the Parents Fund—are recognized as Chancellor&#8217;s Associates. It is the chancellor&#8217;s way of saying thank you and extending the opportunity for you to be part of a community of donors and friends of the university. Learn about giving levels and donor benefits.
