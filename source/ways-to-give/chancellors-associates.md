## Chancellor&#8217;s Associates

Donors who give $1,000 or more annually to one of two discretionary funds—the UC Santa Cruz Fund or the Parents Fund—are recognized as Chancellor&#8217;s Associates. It is the chancellor&#8217;s way of saying thank you and extending the opportunity for you to be part of a community of donors and friends of the university. Learn about giving levels and donor benefits.

## Impact of your gift

Gifts to the UC Santa Cruz Fund and the Parents Fund give the campus the flexibility to invest in areas of greatest impact. Many of the gifts directly support the student experience that so powerfully distinguishes UC Santa Cruz.

## Giving levels and benefits of giving

He is doing that by making the library a beneficiary in his estate plans. And he is a Chancellor&#8217;s Associate, providing the chancellor resources now to invest where needed—including extending hours at McHenry Library.
