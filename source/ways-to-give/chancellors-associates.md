Donors who give $1,000 or more annually to one of two discretionary funds—the UC Santa Cruz Fund or the Parents Fund—are recognized as Chancellor&#8217;s Associates. It is the chancellor&#8217;s way of saying thank you and extending the opportunity for you to be part of a community of donors and friends of the university. Learn about giving levels and donor benefits.

## Impact of your gift

David Kirk, retired media specialist at McHenry Library, supports the library and campus he spent 29 years helping build. He is doing that by making the library a beneficiary in his estate plans. And he is a Chancellor&#8217;s Associate, providing the chancellor resources now to invest where needed—including extending hours at McHenry Library.
