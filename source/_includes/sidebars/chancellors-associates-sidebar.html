  David Kirk, retired media specialist at McHenry Library, supports the library and campus he spent 29 years helping build. He is doing that by making the library a beneficiary in his estate plans. And he is a Chancellor&#8217;s Associate, providing the chancellor resources now to invest where neededâ€”including extending hours at McHenry Library.
