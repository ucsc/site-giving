The growing number of people living on the streets due to the affordable housing crisis in California has been called <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-garcetti-state-of-city-20180416-story.html">“the greatest moral and humanitarian crisis of our time"</a> by the mayor of Los Angeles.
